### Accell Music Player (AMP)

This project aims to create an external music player for Accell Music Files (AMF files), which are note block music files used for the SnowfoxMC Minecraft server. In creating the AMP, I hope to make a program that provides easier access to the music creation features of the server.

Goals:
- interpret and display the notes for the provided AMF file
- allow changes to be made to AMF files, as well as allow users to save new AMF projects
- allow AMF files to be played outside of the server through this application
